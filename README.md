# Google play store (EDA)
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of mobile applications from the Google Play Store. The dataset contained information on various aspects of the apps, including their ratings, reviews, category, and size.

Through my analysis, I gained several insights into the data. For instance, I found that the majority of the apps in the dataset were free, with a few exceptions. I also discovered that the most popular categories were communication, social, and tools, while the least popular were beauty, events, and parenting.

Using data visualization techniques such as bar graphs and scatterplots, I was able to identify patterns and relationships in the data. For example, I found that there was a positive correlation between the number of installs and the app rating, suggesting that higher-rated apps tended to have more downloads.

## Tasks to be performed :-

* Understand the dataset, types and missing values.
* Clean the dataset and handle the missing values,duplicate values,etc.
